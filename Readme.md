# How to edit merged cells in GridView


<p>By default, GridView does not support editing of merged cells. Instead, we recommend using our <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/12063/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet">Spreadsheet</a> that supports this feature out of the box:<br><br><a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/windowsforms/15416/controls-and-libraries/spreadsheet/examples/cells/how-to-merge-cells-or-split-merged-cells">How to: Merge Cells or Split Merged Cells</a> <br>

## ***If the Spreadsheet control does not suit you, we will be happy to find the most appropriate solution for you if you describe your real-life scenario. Just click <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Create">here</a> to submit a ticket to our Support Center.***
  
  
  
This example demonstrates how to create a custom GridView that supports this functionality. </p><p>The saving logic is implemented in the PostEditor method. If you wish, you can change the implementation as your needs dictate.</p>
